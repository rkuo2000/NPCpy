) -> List[str]:
    """Extract concise facts from text using LLM (as defined earlier)"""
    # Implementation from your previous code
    prompt = """Extract concise facts from this text.
        A fact is a piece of information that makes a statement about the world.
        A fact is typically a sentence that is true or false.
        Facts may be simple or complex. They can also be conflicting with each other, usually
        because there is some hidden context that is not mentioned in the text.
        In any case, it is simply your job to extract a list of facts that could pertain to
        an individual's personality.
        
        For example, if a message says:
            "since I am a doctor I am often trying to think up new ways to help people.
            Can you help me set up a new kind of software to help with that?"
        You might extract the following facts:
            - The individual is a doctor
            - They are helpful

        Another example:
            "I am a software engineer who loves to play video games. I am also a huge fan of the
            Star Wars franchise and I am a member of the 501st Legion."
        You might extract the following facts:
            - The individual is a software engineer
            - The individual loves to play video games
            - The individual is a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise
            - The individual is a member of the 501st Legion

        Another example:
            "The quantum tunneling effect allows particles to pass through barriers
            that classical physics says they shouldn't be able to cross. This has
            huge implications for semiconductor design."
        You might extract these facts:
            - Quantum tunneling enables particles to pass through barriers that are
              impassable according to classical physics
            - The behavior of quantum tunneling has significant implications for
              how semiconductors must be designed

        Another example:
            "People used to think the Earth was flat. Now we know it's spherical,
            though technically it's an oblate spheroid due to its rotation."
        You might extract these facts:
            - People historically believed the Earth was flat
            - It is now known that the Earth is an oblate spheroid
            - The Earth's oblate spheroid shape is caused by its rotation

        Another example:
            "My research on black holes suggests they emit radiation, but my professor
            says this conflicts with Einstein's work. After reading more papers, I
            learned this is actually Hawking radiation and doesn't conflict at all."
        You might extract the following facts:
            - Black holes emit radiation
            - The professor believes this radiation conflicts with Einstein's work
            - The radiation from black holes is called Hawking radiation
            - Hawking radiation does not conflict with Einstein's work

        Another example:
            "During the pandemic, many developers switched to remote work. I found
            that I'm actually more productive at home, though my company initially
            thought productivity would drop. Now they're keeping remote work permanent."
        You might extract the following facts:
            - The pandemic caused many developers to switch to remote work
            - The individual discovered higher productivity when working from home
            - The company predicted productivity would decrease with remote work
            - The company decided to make remote work a permanent option

        Thus, it is your mission to reliably extract lists of facts.

            *   Gerunds (words ending in -ing when used as nouns, like "Understanding", "Analyzing", "Processing"). If a gerund is unavoidable, try to make it a specific action (e.g., "User Authentication Module" is better than "Authenticating Users").
            *   Adverbs or descriptive adjectives that don't form a core part of the subject's identity (e.g., "Quickly calculating", "Effectively managing").
            *   Overly generic terms (e.g., "Concepts", "Processes", "Dynamics", "Mechanics", "Analysis", "Understanding", "Interactions", "Relationships", "Properties", "Structures", "Systems", "Frameworks", "Predictions", "Outcomes", "Effects", "Considerations", "Methods", "Techniques", "Data", "Theoretical", "Physical", "Spatial", "Temporal").
        4.  **Direct Naming:** If an item is a specific entity or action, it can be a group name itself (e.g., "Earth", "Lamb Shank Braising", "World War I").
        
        EXAMPLE:
        Input {item_type.capitalize()}: ["Self-intersection shocks drive accretion disk formation.", "Gravity stretches star into stream.", "Energy dissipation in shocks influences capture fraction."]

    GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING DISTINCT GROUPS:
    1.  **Prioritize Specificity and Direct Naming:** Favor precise nouns or noun phrases that directly name the subject.
    2.  **Prefer Concrete Entities/Actions:** If a name refers to a specific entity or action (e.g., "Earth", "Sun", "Water", "France", "User Authentication Module", "Lamb Shank Braising", "World War I"), keep it if it's distinct.
    3.  **Rephrase Gerunds:** If a name uses a gerund (e.g., "Understanding TDEs"), rephrase it to a noun or noun phrase (e.g., "Tidal Disruption Events").
    4.  **AVOID OVERLY GENERIC TERMS:** Do NOT use very broad or abstract terms that don't add specific meaning. Examples to avoid: "Concepts", "Processes", "Dynamics", "Mechanics", "Analysis", "Understanding", "Interactions", "Relationships", "Properties", "Structures", "Systems", "Frameworks", "Predictions", "Outcomes", "Effects", "Considerations", "Methods", "Techniques", "Data", "Theoretical", "Physical", "Spatial", "Temporal". If a group name seems overly generic or abstract, it should likely be removed or refined.
