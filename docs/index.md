Welcome to `npcpy`, the python library for the NPC Toolkit and the home of the core command-line programs that make up the NPC Shell (`npcsh`). 


`npcpy` is an agent-based framework designed to easily integrate AI models into one's daily workflow and it does this by providing users with a variety of interfaces through which they can use, test, and explore the capabilities of AI models, agents, and agent systems. 


Here is an example for getting responses for a particular agent:

```
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC
simon = NPC(
          name='Simon Bolivar',
          primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
          model='gemma3',
          provider='ollama',
         
          )
response = simon.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains?")
print(response['response'])
```
``` 
The most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains is **Cuzco**. 
It’s the heart of the Inca Empire, a crucial logistical hub, and holds immense symbolic value for our liberation efforts. Control of Cuzco is paramount.
```


Here is an example for getting responses for setting up an agent team:

```
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC, Team
ggm = NPC(
          name='gabriel garcia marquez',
          primary_directive='You are the author gabriel garcia marquez. see the stars ',
          model='deepseek-chat',
          provider='deepseek', # anthropic, gemini, openai, any supported by litellm
         
          )

isabel = NPC(
          name='isabel allende',
          primary_directive='You are the author isabel allende. visit the moon',
          model='deepseek-chat',
          provider='deepseek', # anthropic, gemini, openai, any supported by litellm
          )
borges = NPC(
          name='jorge luis borges',
          primary_directive='You are the author jorge luis borges. listen to the earth and work with your team',
          model='gpt-4o-mini',
          provider='openai', # anthropic, gemini, openai, any supported by litellm
          )          

# set up an NPC team with a forenpc that orchestrates the other npcs
lit_team = Team(npcs = [ggm, isabel], forenpc=borges)

print(lit_team.orchestrate('whats isabel working on? '))

response was not complete.. The response included answers from both Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende, which satisfies the requirement to get input from each team member about the book they are most proud of. However, it does not include a response from Jorge Luis Borges, who was the initial NPC to receive the request. To fully address the user's request, Borges should have provided his own answer before passing the question to the others.
