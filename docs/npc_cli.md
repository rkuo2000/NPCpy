## NPC CLI
When npcsh is installed, it comes with the `npc` cli as well. The `npc` cli has various command to make initializing and serving NPC projects easier.

Users can make queries like so:
```bash
$ npc 'whats the biggest filei  n my computer'
Loaded .env file from /home/caug/npcww/npcsh
action chosen: request_input
explanation given: The user needs to provide more context about their operating system or specify which directory to search for the biggest file.

Additional input needed: The user did not specify their operating system or the directory to search for the biggest file, making it unclear how to execute the command.
Please specify your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and the directory you want to search in.: linux and root
action chosen: execute_command
explanation given: The user is asking for the biggest file on their computer, which can be accomplished with a simple bash command that searches for the largest files.

LLM suggests the following bash command: sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1
Running command: sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1
Command executed with output: 11G       /home/caug/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--state-spaces--mamba-2.8b/blobs/39911a8470a2b256016b57cc71c68e0f96751cba5b229216ab1f4f9d82096a46

I ran a command on your Linux system that searches for the largest files on your computer. The command `sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1` performs the following steps:

1. **Find Command**: It searches for all files (`-type f`) starting from the root directory (`/`).
2. **Disk Usage**: For each file found, it calculates its disk usage in a human-readable format (`du -h`).
3. **Sort**: It sorts the results in reverse order based on size (`sort -rh`), so the largest files appear first.
4. **Head**: Finally, it retrieves just the largest file using `head -n 1`.

The output indicates that the biggest file on your system is located at `/home/caug/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--state-spaces--mamba-2.8b/blobs/39911a8470a2b256016b57cc71c68e0f96751cba5b229216ab1f4f9d82096a46` and is 11GB in size.

## Serving
To serve an NPC project, first install redis-server and start it

on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server
redis-server
```

on macOS:
```bash
brew install redis
redis-server
```
Then navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npc serve
```
If you want to specify a certain port, you can do so with the `-p` flag:
```bash
npc serve -p 5337
```
or with the `--port` flag:
```bash
npc serve --port 5337

```
If you want to initialize a project based on templates and then make it available for serving, you can do so like this
```bash
npc serve -t 'sales, marketing' -ctx 'im developing a team that will focus on sales and marketing within the logging industry. I need a team that can help me with the following: - generate leads - create marketing campaigns - build a sales funnel - close deals - manage customer relationships - manage sales pipeline - manage marketing campaigns - manage marketing budget' -m llama3.2 -pr ollama
```
This will use the specified model and provider to generate a team of npcs to fit the templates and context provided.


Once the server is up and running, you can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:5337/api/`. Here are some example curl commands to test the endpoints:

```bash
echo "Testing health endpoint..."
curl -s http://localhost:5337/api/health | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting execute endpoint..."
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5337/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"commandstr": "hello world", "currentPath": "~/", "conversationId": "test124"}' | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting conversations endpoint..."
curl -s "http://localhost:5337/api/conversations?path=/tmp" | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting conversation messages endpoint..."
curl -s http://localhost:5337/api/conversation/test123/messages | jq '.'
```

## Planned cli features

# Macros

While npcsh can decide the best option to use based on the user's input, the user can also execute certain actions with a macro. Macros are commands within the NPC shell that start with a forward slash (/) and are followed (in some cases) by the relevant arguments for those macros. Each macro is also available as a sub-program within the NPC CLI. In the following examples we demonstrate how to carry out the same operations from within npcsh and from a regular shell.


To learn about the available macros from within the shell, type:
```npcsh
npcsh> /help
```

or from bash
```bash
npc --help
#alternatively
npc -h
```
