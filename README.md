Here is an example for getting responses for a particular agent:

```python
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC
simon = NPC(
          name='Simon Bolivar',
          primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
          model='gemma3:4b',
          provider='ollama'
          )
response = simon.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains?")
print(response['response'])

```

```python 
The most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains is **Cuzco**. 
It’s the heart of the Inca Empire, a crucial logistical hub, and holds immense symbolic value for our liberation efforts. Control of Cuzco is paramount.
```


Here is an example for getting responses for a particular agent with tools:

```python
import os
import json
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC
from npcpy.npc_sysenv import render_markdown

def list_files(directory: str = ".") -> list:
    """List all files in a directory."""
    return os.listdir(directory)

def read_file(filepath: str) -> str:
    """Read and return the contents of a file."""
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()

# Create an agent with fast, verifiable tools
assistant = NPC(
    name='File Assistant',
    primary_directive='You are a helpful assistant who can list and read files.',
    model='llama3.2',
    provider='ollama',
    tools=[list_files, read_file], 

)

response = assistant.get_llm_response(
    "List the files in the current directory.",
    auto_process_tool_calls=True, #this is the default for NPCs, but not the default for get_llm_response/upstream
)
# show the keys of the response for get_llm_response
print(response.keys())
```
```
dict_keys(['response', 'raw_response', 'messages', 'tool_calls', 'tool_results'])
```

```python
for tool_call in response['tool_results']:
    render_markdown(tool_call['tool_call_id'])
    for arg in tool_call['arguments']:
        render_markdown('- ' + arg + ': ' + str(tool_call['arguments'][arg]))
    render_markdown('- Results:' + str(tool_call['result']))
```

```python
 • directory: .                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 • Results:['research_pipeline.jinx', '.DS_Store', 'mkdocs.yml', 'LICENSE', '.pytest_cache', 'npcpy', 'Makefile', 'test_data', 'README.md.backup', 'tests', 'screenshot.png', 'MANIFEST.in', 'docs', 'hero_image_tech_startup.png', 'README.md',

```



Here is an example for setting up an agent team to use Jinja Execution (Jinxs) templates that are processed entirely with prompts, allowing you to use them with models that do or do not possess tool calling support.

```python
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC, Team, Jinx
from npcpy.tools import auto_tools
import os



file_reader_jinx = Jinx(jinx_data={
    "jinx_name": "file_reader",
    "description": "Read a file and summarize its contents",
    "inputs": ["filename"],
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "read_file",
            "engine": "python",
            "code": """
import os
with open(os.path.abspath('{{ filename }}'), 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
output= content
            """
        },
        {
            "name": "summarize_content",
            "engine": "natural",
            "code": """
                Summarize the content of the file: {{ read_file }}.
            """
        }
    ]
})


# Define a jinx for literary research
literary_research_jinx = Jinx(jinx_data={
    "jinx_name": "literary_research",
    "description": "Research a literary topic, analyze files, and summarize findings",
    "inputs": ["topic"],
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "gather_info",
            "engine": "natural",
            "code": """
                Research the topic: {{ topic }}.
                Summarize the main themes and historical context.
            """
        },
        {
            "name": "final_summary",
            "engine": "natural",
            "code": """
                Based on the research in. {{gather_info}}, write a concise, creative summary.
            """
        }
    ]
})

ggm = NPC(
    name='Gabriel Garcia Marquez',
    primary_directive='You are Gabriel Garcia Marquez, master of magical realism. Research, analyze, and write with poetic flair.',
    model='gemma3:4b',
    provider='ollama',
)

isabel = NPC(
    name='Isabel Allende',
    primary_directive='You are Isabel Allende, weaving stories with emotion and history. Analyze texts and provide insight.',

# Set up a team with a forenpc that orchestrates the other npcs

)

# Example: Orchestrate a jinx workflow

```
```python
print(lit_team.orchestrate('which book are your team members most proud of? ask them please. '))
```  

```python
{'debrief': {'summary': "The responses provided detailed accounts of the books that the NPC team members, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende, are most proud of. Gabriel highlighted 'Cien años de soledad,' while Isabel spoke of 'La Casa de los Espíritus.' Both authors expressed deep personal connections to their works, illustrating their significance in Latin American literature and their own identities.", 'recommendations': 'Encourage further engagement with each author to explore more about their literary contributions, or consider asking about themes in their works or their thoughts on current literary trends.'}, 'execution_history': [{'messages': ...}]}
```

LLM responses can be obtained without NPCs as well.

```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response
response = get_llm_response("Who was the celtic Messenger god?", model='mistral:7b', provider='ollama')
print(response['response'])
```

```
The Celtic messenger god is often associated with the figure of Tylwyth Teg, also known as the Tuatha Dé Danann (meaning "the people of the goddess Danu"). However, among the various Celtic cultures, there are a few gods and goddesses that served similar roles.

One of the most well-known Celtic messengers is Brigid's servant, Líth (also spelled Lid or Lith), who was believed to be a spirit guide for messengers and travelers in Irish mythology.
```
The structure of npcpy also allows one to pass an npc
to `get_llm_response` in addition to using the NPC's wrapped method, 
allowing you to be flexible in your implementation and testing.
```python
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response
simon = NPC(
          name='Simon Bolivar',
          primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
          model='gemma3:4b',
          provider='ollama'
          )
response = get_llm_response("Who was the mythological chilean bird that guides lucky visitors to gold?", npc=simon)
print(response['response'])
```
Users are not required to pass agents to get_llm_response, so you can work with LLMs without requiring agents in each case.


`npcpy` also supports streaming responses, with the `response` key containing a generator in such cases which can be printed and processed through the print_and_process_stream method.


```python
from npcpy.npc_sysenv import print_and_process_stream
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response
response = get_llm_response("When did the united states government begin sending advisors to vietnam?", model='qwen2.5:14b', provider='ollama', stream = True)

full_response = print_and_process_stream(response['response'], 'llama3.2', 'ollama')
```
Return structured outputs by specifying `format='json'` or passing a Pydantic schema. When specific formats are extracted, `npcpy`'s `get_llm_response` will convert the response from its string representation so you don't have to worry about that. 

```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response
response = get_llm_response("What is the sentiment of the american people towards the repeal of Roe v Wade? Return a json object with `sentiment` as the key and a float value from -1 to 1 as the value", model='deepseek-coder', provider='deepseek', format='json')

print(response['response'])
```
```
{'sentiment': -0.7}
```

The `get_llm_response` function also can take a list of messages and will additionally return the messages with the user prompt and the assistant response appended if the response is not streamed. If it is streamed, the user must manually append the conversation result as part of their workflow if they want to then pass the messages back in.

Additionally, one can pass attachments. Here we demonstrate both
```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import get_llm_response
messages = [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an annoyed assistant.'}]

response = get_llm_response("What is the meaning of caesar salad", model='llama3.2', provider='ollama', images=['./Language_Evolution_and_Innovation_experiment.png'], messages=messages)



```
Easily create images with the generate_image function, using models available through Huggingface's diffusers library or from OpenAI or Gemini.
```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import gen_image
image = gen_image("make a picture of the moon in the summer of marco polo", model='runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5', provider='diffusers')

image = gen_image("kitten toddler in a bouncy house of fluffy gorilla", model='Qwen/Qwen-Image', provider='diffusers')

image = gen_image("make a picture of the moon in the summer of marco polo", model='dall-e-2', provider='openai')


# edit images with 'gpt-image-1' or gemini's multimodal models, passing image paths, byte code images, or PIL instances.

image = gen_image("make a picture of the moon in the summer of marco polo", model='gpt-image-1', provider='openai', attachments=['/path/to/your/image.jpg', your_byte_code_image_here, your_PIL_image_here])


image = gen_image("edit this picture of the moon in the summer of marco polo so that it looks like it is in the winter of nishitani", model='gemini-2.0-flash', provider='gemini', attachments= [])

```

Likewise, generate videos :

```python
from npcpy.llm_funcs import gen_video
video = gen_video("make a video of the moon in the summer of marco polo", model='runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5', provider='diffusers')
```

Or audio TTS and STT:
```
from npcpy.gen.audio_gen import tts_elevenlabs
audio = tts_elevenlabs('''The representatives of the people of France, formed into a National Assembly,
considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights, are the sole causes of
public misfortunes and corruptions of Government, have resolved to set forth in a solemn
declaration, these natural, imprescriptible, and inalienable rights: that this declaration
being constantly present to the minds of the members of the body social, they may be for
ever kept attentive to their rights and their duties; that the acts of the legislative and
executive powers of government, being capable of being every moment compared with
the end of political institutions, may be more respected; and also, that the future claims of
the citizens, being directed by simple and incontestable principles, may tend to the
maintenance of the Constitution, and the general happiness. ''')
# it will play the audio automatically.
```
## Serving an NPC Team

`npcpy` includes a built-in Flask server that makes it easy to deploy NPC teams for production use. You can serve teams with tools, jinxs, and complex workflows that frontends can interact with via REST APIs.

### Basic Team Server Setup

```python
from npcpy.serve import start_flask_server
from npcpy.npc_compiler import NPC, Team
from npcpy.tools import auto_tools
import requests
import os

# Create NPCs with different specializations
researcher = NPC(
    name='Research Specialist',
    primary_directive='You are a research specialist who finds and analyzes information from various sources.',
    model='claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
    provider='anthropic'
)

analyst = NPC(
    name='Data Analyst',
    primary_directive='You are a data analyst who processes and interprets research findings.',
    model='gpt-4o',
    provider='openai'
)

coordinator = NPC(
    name='Project Coordinator',
    primary_directive='You coordinate team activities and synthesize results into actionable insights.',
    model='gemini-1.5-pro',
    provider='gemini'
)

# Create team
research_team = Team(
    npcs=[researcher, analyst],
    forenpc=coordinator
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Register team and NPCs directly with the server
    npcs = {npc.name: npc for npc in list(research_team.npcs.values()) + [research_team.forenpc]}
    start_flask_server(
        port=5337,
        cors_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"],  # Allow frontend access
        debug=True,
        teams={'research_team': research_team},
        npcs=npcs
    )
```



## Read the Docs

## Enabling Innovation and Research
- `npcpy` is a framework that speeds up and simplifies the development of NLP-based or Agent-based applications and provides developers and researchers with methods to explore and test across dozens of models, providers, and personas as well as other model-level hyperparameters (e.g. `temperature`, `top_k`, etc.), incorporating an array of data sources and common tools.
- The `npcpy` agent data layer makes it easy to set up teams and serve them so you can focus more on the agent personas and less on the nitty gritty of inference.
- `npcpy` provides pioneering methods in the construction and updating of knowledge graphs as well as in the development and testing of novel mixture of agent scenarios.
- In `npcpy`, all agentic capabilities are developed and tested using small local models (like `llama3.2`, `gemma3`) to ensure it can function reliably at the edge of computing.

We support inference via all providers supported by litellm. For openai-compatible providers that are not explicitly named in litellm, use simply `openai-like` as the provider. The default provider must be one of `['openai','anthropic','ollama', 'gemini', 'deepseek', 'openai-like']` and the model must be one available from those providers.

To use tools that require API keys, create an `.env` file in the folder where you are working or place relevant API keys as env variables in your ~/.npcshrc. If you already have these API keys set in a ~/.bashrc or a ~/.zshrc or similar files, you need not additionally add them to ~/.npcshrc or to an `.env` file. Here is an example of what an `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_deepseek_key'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_key'
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_perplexity_key'
```


 Individual npcs can also be set to use different models and providers by setting the `model` and `provider` keys in the npc files.


For cases where you wish to set up a team of NPCs, jinxs, and assembly lines, add a `npc_team` directory to your project and then initialize an NPC Team.
```bash
./npc_team/            # Project-specific NPCs
├── jinxs/             # Project jinxs #example jinx next
│   └── example.jinx
└── assembly_lines/    # Project workflows
    └── example.pipe
└── models/    # Project workflows
    └── example.model
└── example1.npc        # Example NPC
└── example2.npc        # Example NPC
└── team.ctx            # Example ctx
